puts "Once upon a time there was a little #{living_creature} who was loved by everyone who looked at her,
but most of all by her #{family_member}.
Once her #{family_member} gave her a little #{clothes} of #{color} velvet, which suited her so well that she would never wear anything else;
so she was always called 'Little #{color.capitalize} #{clothes.capitalize}'.
One day her #{family_member2} said to her: 'Come, #{color.capitalize} #{clothes.capitalize},
here is a piece of #{food} and #{number} bottles of #{drink};
take them to your grandmother, she has #{disease}, and they will do her good.
Set out before it gets #{weather_adjective}, and when you are going, walk #{adverb} and #{adverb2}
and do not run off the path, or you may #{verb} and break the #{fragile};
and when you go into her room, don't forget to say, '#{greeting}'."
